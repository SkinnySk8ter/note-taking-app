# note-taking-app
An app that helps the user save and delete their notes

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

# HOW TO RUN 
1. Open terminal
2. Clone the file into an empty folder
3. run the command 'npm install' (may need to also install express and fs)
4. run 'npm start'
5. Once connected to the server - type in localhost:(the number the server is listening on) in web broswer

Currently have the ability to either add new notes or delete existing ones. There is not an update button yet (Just in case you wanted to add something new to an already existing note).
