# note-taking-app

## Description

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete


HOW TO RUN 
Open terminal
Clone the file into an empty folder
run the command 'npm install'
run 'npm start'
Once connected to the server - type in localhost:(the number the server is listening on) in web broswer

Currently have the ability to either add new notes or delete existing ones. There is not an update button yet (Just in case you wanted to add something new to an already existing note).
