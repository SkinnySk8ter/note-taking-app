# note-taking-app
An app that helps the user save and delete their notes

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete


HOW TO RUN
Open terminal
run the command 'npm install'
then run 'npm start'

Currently have the ability to either add new notes or delete existing ones. There is not an update button yet (Just in case you wanted to add something new to an already existing note).
